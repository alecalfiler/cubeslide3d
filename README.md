Summary
Cube Slide is a simple music platformer where you play as a geometric cube within a neon grid.
The rules are simple, keep heading towards one direction until you reach the finish line.
The catch is you must avoid running into obstacles by simply jumping over them.
Your cube automatically moves towards the x direction in a constant pace,
so all you have to do is to hit the spacebar to jump over obstacles.
